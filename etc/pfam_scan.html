<h1><a name="name">NAME</a></h1>
<p>pfam_scan.pl - search protein fasta sequences against the Pfam
library of HMMs.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="version">VERSION</a></h1>
<p>This is version 0.5 of pfam_scan.pl.  See the history section for
recent changes.</p>
<p>Behaviour of recent versions is a significantly different from 0.1.
From version 0.5, overlapping matches to families within the same clan
are removed, keeping the best scoring hit.  This behaviour can be
overridden with the --overlap option.  From version 0.2, we can use
BLAST to preprocess the input sequences with the --fast option, so we
only have to search a subset of sequences against a subset of HMMs
using hmmpfam.  For puritanical reasons we don't do this by default!
Read the notes about this below.</p>
<p>This version has been tested with Perl 5.6.1, Pfam 10.0 (through
13.0), Bioperl 1.2 and HMMER 2.3.1.  It should work with any versions
higher than these.</p>
<p>

<h1><a name="requirements">REQUIREMENTS</a></h1>
<pre>
 - this script
 - Perl 5.6 or higher (and maybe lower)
 - The Pfam database (downloadable from
   <a href="ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/">ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/</a>)
 - HMMER software (from <a href="http://hmmer.wustl.edu/">http://hmmer.wustl.edu/</a>)
 - NCBI BLAST binaries (from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Ftp/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Ftp/</a>)
 - Bioperl (from <a href="http://bio.perl.org/">http://bio.perl.org/</a>)</pre>
<p>The Bioperl modules directory must be in your perl library path, and
the HMMER and BLAST binaries must be in your executable path.</p>
<p>You also need to be able to read and write to /tmp on your machine.</p>
<p>Some of these requirements are easily circumvented, but this script
should at least give you a start.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="how_to_install_pfam_locally">HOW TO INSTALL PFAM LOCALLY</a></h1>
<p>1. Get the Pfam database from
   <a href="ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/.">ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/.</a>  In particular you need
   the files Pfam-A.fasta, Pfam_ls, Pfam_fs, and Pfam-A.seed.</p>
<p>2. Unzip them if necessary
    $ gunzip Pfam*.gz</p>
<p>3. Grab and install HMMER, NCBI BLAST and Bioperl, and make sure your
   paths etc are set up properly.</p>
<p>4. Index Pfam-A.fasta for BLAST searches
    $ formatdb -i Pfam-A.fasta -p T</p>
<p>5. Index the Pfam_ls and Pfam_fs libraries for HMM fetching
    $ hmmindex Pfam_ls
    $ hmmindex Pfam_fs</p>
<p>
</p>

<h1><a name="searching_pfam">SEARCHING PFAM</a></h1>
<p>This script is really just a wrapper around hmmpfam.</p>
<p>Run pfam_scan.pl -h to get a list of options.  Probably the only thing
to worry about is supplying the -d option with the location of your
downloaded Pfam database.  Or you can set the PFAMDB environment
variable to point to the right place and things should work without
-d.  And you should decide whether or not to use --fast.</p>
<p>A few things to note:</p>
<p>--fast uses BLAST as a preprocessor to reduce the amount of compute we
have to do with hmmpfam.  This is known to reduce sensitivity in the
case of a very small number of families (those whose length is
exceptionally short, like the XYPPX repeat).  If you're annotating
genomes then you *probably* don't care too much about these families.
Omiting this option may give you a small added sensitivity, but with a
rough 10 fold time cost.  If you want to exactly replicate the Pfam
web site results or distributed data, you probably shouldn't use this.</p>
<p>Overlapping above-threshold hits to families within the same clan are
removed -- only the best scoring hit is kept.  You can override this
behaviour with the --overlap option.</p>
<p>Pfam provides two sets of models, called ls and fs models, for whole
domain and fragment searches.  This wrapper basically returns all hits
to the ls models, and then adds to these all non-overlapping hits to
the fragment models.  This mimics the behaviour of Pfam web site
searches.  You can choose to search only one set of models with the
--mode option.</p>
<p>Unless you want to grub around in the noise you should probably use
the default thresholds - these are hand curated for every family by
the Pfam team, such that we believe false positives will not score
above these levels.  The consequence is that some families may miss
members.</p>
<p>You may want to adjust the threshold used for the preprocessing BLAST
search (default evalue 10).  Raising this to 50 will slow everything
down a bit but may gain you a little sensitivity.  Lowering the evalue
cutoff will speed things up but with an inevitable sensitivity cost.</p>
<p>It is important that each sequence in the fasta file has a unique
identifier.  Note that the fasta header format should be:</p>
<p>&gt;identifier  &lt;optional description&gt;</p>
<p>so the identifier should not contain whitespace.</p>
<p>The format of the output is:</p>
<p>&lt;seq id&gt; &lt;seq start&gt; &lt;seq end&gt; &lt;hmm acc&gt; &lt;hmm start&gt; &lt;hmm end&gt; &lt;bit score&gt; &lt;evalue&gt; &lt;hmm name&gt;</p>
<p>hmmpfam returns scores for sequence and domain matches seperately.
For simplicity, the single line for each domain format returned here
reports domain scores.</p>

<h1><a name="bugs">BUGS</a></h1>
<p>Many options are not rigorously tested.  Error messages are
uninformative.  The documentation is inadequate.  You may find it
useful.  You may not.</p>

<h1><a name="history">HISTORY</a></h1>
<p>Version     Main changes
-------     ------------</p>
<p>0.5         Removes overlapping above-threshold hits to families
            within the same clan. --overlap overrides.</p>
<p>0.4         Work-around for hmmpfam bug/feature that reports hits
            above domain threshold even if the sequence doesn't 
            score above the sequence threshold.</p>
<p>0.3         Fix minor bugs to be compatable with HMM versions in
            Pfam 13.</p>
<p>0.2         --fast option to use BLAST preprocessing for significant
            speed-up.</p>
<p>0.1         First effort, simply wraps up hmmpfam without doing
            anything clever.</p>
